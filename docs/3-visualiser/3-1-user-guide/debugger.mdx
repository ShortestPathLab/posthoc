- A use case would be using an if statement and return true for a certain condtion of a breakpoint.
- For further trying and error within this advanced breakpoint editor, use print statements (console.log) to print values of the parameters, the output of these print statements can be seen in teh web console (Inspect the web).

## Stepping through the breakpoints
- To step through the trace and jump to the next breakpoint, make a new steps panel by splitting an existing panel, 
- Scroll the header of the panel sideways to reveal the jump to next breakpoint button.
- Red dots on the steps indicates that the breakpoint will hit on that step.
