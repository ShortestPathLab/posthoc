# Single Agent Grid Search

Follow these steps to visualise a single-agent search, in our case A\*, on a grid map.

## Prepare the Map

We support grid maps as `.grid` files. A `.grid` file is a text file that looks like this:

```txt title="cross.grid"
type octile
height 5
width 5
map
.....
..@..
.@@@.
..@..
.....
```

Save this file as `cross.grid` to your system.

## Load the Map

- In the **Layer** panel, click **+ Layer** to add a new layer.
- Click the pencil icon to edit the layer.
- For **Type**, choose **Map**.
- For **Source**, choose **Import Map**, then pick `cross.grid` from your system.
- Close the **Edit Layer** modal.
- In the **Viewport** panel, click **Fit** to fit the map to the viewport.

This should be the result:

## Prepare the Search Trace

You can generate the search trace in a number of ways depending on your solver.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="raw" label="Demo Search Trace">
    Download [this](./cross-example.trace.yaml) pre-computed search trace.

    The file should start like this:

    ```yaml title="example.trace.yaml"
    render:
      components:
        tile:
          - $: rect
            width: 1
            height: 1
            x: "{{$.event.x}}"
            y: "{{$.event.y}}"
            fill: "{{$.color[$.event.type]}}"
      views:
        main:
          components:
            - $: tile
      path:
        pivot:
          x: "{{$.event.x + 0.5}}"
          y: "{{$.event.y + 0.5}}"
        scale: 0.3
    events:
      - type: source
        id: 96
        x: 0
        y: 0
      - type: destination
        id: 228
        x: 4
        y: 4
    ```

    The search trace contains a record of the events that occured during the search and how to visualise them.

    ## Load the Search Trace

    <LoadSearchTrace />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="warthog" label="Warthog">

    TODO: explain on how warthog can be download and used through the terminal and produce a search trace

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="query" label="Query">

    By default, Visualiser is bundled with a WebAssembly version of Warthog, a solver for grid maps.

    Check that **Warthog (WebAssembly)** is enabled in the **Settings** panel, in the **Connections** tab.

    ## Adding the Query

    - In the **Layer** panel, click **+ Layer** to add a new layer.
    - Click the pencil icon to edit the layer.
    - For **Type**, choose **Query**.
    - For **Algorithm**, choose the algorithm that you want to visualise.
    - For **Map**, choose a map that you have chose.
    - Close the **Edit Layer** modal.

    ## Adding Source and Destination
    - Left click on any part of the map that you wanted to be set as a source, then **Set as Source**
    - Do the same for the destination click **Set as Destination**
    - A green pixel will show up marking the source

    A demonstration on how to add a query, destination and source is provided in this [Video](https://youtu.be/7hFjyrnAVkA)

## Step through the Search Trace

<StepThroughSearchTrace />
&nbsp;

A demonstration on how to import a map and a trace is provided in this [Video](https://youtu.be/MkA-Qf2TAZQ)
&nbsp;

You have now visualised an A\* search on a grid map.
