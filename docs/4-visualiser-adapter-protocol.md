# Visualiser Adapter Protocol

The **Visualiser Adapter Protocol** connects solvers directly to the visualiser to enable interactivity and integrations that would otherwise not be possible with search trace files.

**Visualiser Adapter Protocol** goes beyond simple solution-based visualisations. It allows visualisers to interactively run queries on solvers, and solvers to return expressive visualisations as search traces, to help you understand, debug, and experiment with your code.

This API is yet to be finalised. The definition for the current version of this protocol is available [here](https://github.com/ShortestPathLab/posthoc-app/blob/master/protocol/index.ts), but expect large changes soon.
